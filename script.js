// RobCo TERMLINK — Phase 1 navigation
//
// The whole site is one page. Each terminal "screen" (main menu, whoami,
// projects, contact) is a <section> in index.html, and only one is visible
// at a time. This file's single job is swapping which screen is shown.
// The typing engine and command input arrive in later phases — until then,
// this file stays deliberately small.

"use strict";

// Every screen we can switch between. Phase 1 never adds or removes
// sections after load, so grabbing them once up front is enough.
const screens = document.querySelectorAll("main > section");

// Show the screen whose id matches `targetId`; hide all the others.
// The `hidden` attribute removes a section from both sight and the
// keyboard order, so visitors can't tab into an invisible screen.
function showScreen(targetId) {
  for (const screen of screens) {
    screen.hidden = screen.id !== targetId;
  }

  // Send keyboard focus to the new screen's heading. Without this, focus
  // would die on the now-hidden button the visitor just activated, and
  // keyboard or screen-reader users would be stranded.
  const heading = document.querySelector("#" + targetId + " h2");
  if (heading) {
    heading.focus();
  }
}

// Wire-up: every navigation button declares its destination with a
// data-target attribute, so adding a menu entry later means touching
// only the HTML — no new JavaScript.
for (const button of document.querySelectorAll("button[data-target]")) {
  button.addEventListener("click", () => showScreen(button.dataset.target));
}
